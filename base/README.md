# Base bst files

This directory caches a copy of bst files I have used as a base for modifications.  If new versions are released, it may be easier to 'diff' the new version from the base and roll the modifications forward into my version of that bst.


## IEEE styles

Our variant is based on **IEEEtran**, for conferences and journals.

IEEEtran.bst should be available in standard TeX distros:
`/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/IEEEtran/IEEEtran.bst`

As of July 2025, it is at v1.14, per its [maintainer](https://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/bibtex/).

## ACM styles

Our variant is based on the [ACM standard LaTeX template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

As of July 2025, the current ACM style is version 2.1.

## Core LaTeX styles

As of July 2025, the current styles are version 0.99b, as cached in `base0.99b`

Official version can be found in `/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/bibtex/bst/base/`
